# MagicDeckBuilder
Fan-made open-source deck-building format for the popular game Magic The Gathering.

Magic Deck Builder (MDB) Format

MDB is a variant for Magic The Gathering and follows all of the rules of magic except with a few modifications.

RATIONALE:
The idea is to build more opportunities to casual playsets of magic the gathering with the least amount of change and resistance.

MADOFICATION TO THE ZONES:
Confluence: A deck of land cards. Each player would start with 10 cards in their Confluence.
Depot: This functions like the graveyard but is only for lands.
Library and Graveyard: No longer contains lands.
The Aether: a 120 card deck that has cards from magic's history.
    There will be pre-built aether.
    There will be a guideline for making your own aether.
The Flow: a line-up of 5 cards from the aether.
Open World: a colletion of 10 special lands that players can buy.

GAME SETUP:
Each player starts with a confluence of 10 basic lands, 2 of each card type.
Choose an aether and open world to play with.
    Shuffle the aether and place it in the center.
    Display the Open World in the side in full view of all players.
Reveal the top 5 cards of the aether and place them in the center in a row to create the Flow.
Each player draw 6 cards as their starting hand.
Each player gets player tokens equal to the number of opponents and with colors unique to them.

CHANGES TO THE PHASES:
In your draw step, instead of drawing a card, if you have less than 7 cards in your hand, draw cards equal to the difference.
    The starting player does not do this on their first turn.

DRAWING CARDS:
Whenever you draw a card or an effect refers to cards in your library, you can choose if the card will come from your library or confluence
If a card would refer to your library, you can have it refer to either your library or your confluence.
Whenever you would draw a card from either your library or confluence and there aren't any cards in it, shuffle either your graveyard or depot respectively. That becomes your new library or confluence.

PURCHASING:
You may purchase cards from the aether.
    You do so by paying generic mana equal to the card's converted mana cost
    The purchased card goes to your graveyard.
Whenever a card is removed from the flow, replace it with a card from the top of the aether.
You may exile cards from the flow by paying 3 generic mana.
You may obtain cards from the open world.
    To do so, pay 2 generic mana and put a land from your depot to the open world.
    Then place the land you want from the open world into your depot.

ADDITIONAL RULES:
Whenever you tap a land for mana, it goes to your depot.

DYING AND WINNING
Players start with 20 life.
When your life becomes 0, you skip your next turn. 
    If the opponent that dealt the killing blow to you still does not have your player token, they get one of your player tokens.
    After your skipped turn, your life total becomes 10.
    Continue play as usual.

FOR TESTING

DISCARD:
When cards are sent to the discard from play, they only go there at the end of turn. When they are discarded from play they can’t be access from any means except until after they are sent to the discard at the end of turn
    
AETHER CRAFTING GUIDE:
experiential, not competitive. You want it to be tactical, all about building yourself up. Give hindrences to opponents not setting them back.
The cards can consist of any card from any legal Magic the Gathering set. Suggested maximum of 4-6 copies unless stated otherwise.
The selection of card sets will be based on the player’s preference but suggested playsets will be provided on release of this format.
A typical market configuration should have around 20-30 unique card names (along with their appropriate copies)

POSSIBLE CONFLUENCE CONFIGURATION:
4 of same color, 2 of ally color, 1 of enemy color.
