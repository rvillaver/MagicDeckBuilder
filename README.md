# MagicDeckBuilder
Fan-made open-source deck-building format for the popular game Magic The Gathering.

Magic Deck Builder (MDB) Format

MDB is a variant for Magic The Gathering and follows all of the rules of magic except with a few modifications.

Game Setup

Each Player
Mana Deck: Each player starts 10 basic land cards 2 of each type.

Mana Discard: Zone for lands discarded by that player.

Spell Deck: Contains all the spell cards acquired by the player throughout the game.
Spell Discard: Zone for spells discarded by that player.

Common for all players
Card Market
The cards can consist of any card from any legal Magic the Gathering set. Suggested maximum of 4-6 copies unless stated otherwise.

The selection of card sets will be based on the player’s preference but suggested playsets will be provided on release of this format.

A typical market configuration should have around 20-30 unique card names (along with their appropriate copies)

Shuffle all the market cards in the playset, draw 5 and and display inbetween players. Whenever a card is taken from the market, replace it from the top of the deck.

On a player’s turn:

Changes with the draw step:
Draw 7 cards from a combination of cards from your mana deck and spell deck. Whenever any of those decks are empty shuffle the discard pile of that type back to it’s deck before continuing drawing. If you are the starting player you draw 6.

Change with how lands work:
Land cards are used the same way as normal magic except when tapped, they are sent to their mana discard pile at the end of their turn. Also, players may play as many lands as they so choose on their turn. Any unused lands stay untapped and ready to be used in future turns.

Additional Mechanic:
At the beginning of the game, players do not have a spell deck. What they can do instead is to spend mana to “buy” cards from
the spell market for it’s converted mana cost. When a card is bought it goes to the appropriate discard at the end of their turn, spell for non-land, mana for land cards. 

They can buy as many as they wish, the cost of buying the card is the converted mana cost. Except for non-basic lands which will have a minimum CMC of 2.

Change how things are discarded:
When cards are sent to the discard from play, they only go there at the end of turn. When they are discarded from play they can’t be access from any means except until after they are sent to the discard at the end of turn
 
Things that are the same:
At any time they are allowed players may spend mana to play spell cards, summon creatures, artifacts enchaments, planeswalkers from their hand by paying the appropriate cost.

All phases are the same except with the modifications about, creatures still need haste to attack, blocking and damage etc all are the same.

Winning Condition
Players have 40 life, you win if you reduce your opponent’s life to zero.

For multiplayer:

An additional modification of the card name limit is for any player they can have up to 4 * number of players copies of a card in the game.

Whether you are playing team game or free for all, reduce your opponents life to zero to win.

Rational Behind:
The idea is to build more opportunities to casual playsets of magic the gathering with the least amount of change and resistance.
